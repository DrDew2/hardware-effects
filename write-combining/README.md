## Write combining
> (**Inconclusive**) As noted by [this issue](https://github.com/Kobzol/hardware-effects/issues/1), this is probably not actually
caused by write combining. If you have a better idea (number of parallel streams that the hardware prefetcher can handle?),
please let me know!

This example demonstrates write combining present in modern processors.
CPUs have write combining buffers that try to fill a whole cache line before sending it
for a write into cache/memory to reduce bus bandwidth stress/usage.

The number of WC buffers is of course limited, so you get their benefit only when writing to a small number of 
memory streams concurrently. For example if you have 4 WC buffers, you can write to 4 different arrays
repeatedly and the writes should be buffered by the WC buffers. If you write to 5 arrays at once,
one of the writes will not benefit from the write combining.

Usage:
```bash
$ write-combining <array-count> <write-increment>
```

The program will create `array-count` large arrays of 8-bytes integers and will repeatedly write to all of their elements.
`write-increment` specifies how many arrays will be written at once in a loop from zero to the array size.

Example:
```
# creates 6 arrays, first writes to all elements of array 0, then writes to all elements of array 1 etc.
write-combining 6 1

# creates 6 arrays, first writes to all elements of arrays 0,1,2, then writes to all elements of arrays 3,4,5
write-combining 6 3

# creates 6 array, writes to all elements of arrays 0,1,2,3,4,5
write-combining 6 6 
```

It is tricky to demonstrate this effect, but I think that this program's slowdown
can be explained by it. On my computer `count 6, increment 3` is consistently faster than `count 6, increment 6`
even though it does more work (increments the loop counter twice instead of once per each element) and
has more LLC and L1i cache misses (measured by `perf stat`, YMMV). The effect depends on the
number of write combine buffers in your CPU, common number is somewhere between 4 and 10.
I suggest trying combinations `6/3, 6/6, 8/4, 8/8` and so on.
However I suspect that this slowdown could also have something to do with the number of streams that the hardware
prefetcher can follow.


You can use the provided `benchmark.py` script to test various `array-count/write-increment` combinations
and plot their relative speeds.

```bash
$ python3 benchmark.py <path-to-executable>
```
